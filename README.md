An Open Source text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper.
Previously known as **spear-tts-pytorch**.

We want this model to be like Stable Diffusion but for speech – both
powerful and easily customizable.

We are working only with properly licensed speech recordings and all the
code is Open Source so the model will be always safe to use for
commercial applications.

Currently the models are trained on the English LibreLight dataset. In
the next release we want to target multiple languages (Whisper and
EnCodec are both multilanguage).

## Progress update \[2024-01-18\]

We spend the last week optimizing inference performance. We integrated
`torch.compile`, added kv-caching and tuned some of the layers – we are
now working over 12x faster than real-time on a consumer 4090!

We also added an easy way to test voice-cloning. Here is a sample voice
cloned from [a famous speech by Winston
Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Winston_Churchill_-_Be_Ye_Men_of_Valour.ogg):

We can also mix languages in a single sentence (here the highlighted
English project names are seamlessly mixed into Polish speech):

You can [test all of these on
Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/8168a30f26627fcd15076d10c85d9e33c52204cf/Inference%20example.ipynb)
(we optimized the dependencies so now it takes less than 30 seconds to
install). A Huggingface Space is coming soon.

## Progress update \[2024-01-10\]

We’ve pushed a new SD S2A model that is a lot faster while still
generating high-quality speech. We’ve also added an example of voice
cloning based on a reference audio file.

As always, you can [check out our

## Progress update \[2023-12-10\]

Another trio of models, this time they support multiple languages
(English and Polish). Here are two new samples for a sneak peek. You can

## Downloads

We encourage you to start with the Google Colab link above or run the
provided notebook locally. If you want to download manually or train the
models from scratch then both [the WhisperSpeech pre-trained
models](https://huggingface.co/collabora/whisperspeech) as well as [the
converted
datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/whisperspeech) are
available on HuggingFace.

## Roadmap

- [ ] [Gather a bigger emotive speech
  dataset](https://github.com/collabora/spear-tts-pytorch/issues/11)
- [ ] Figure out a way to condition the generation on emotions and
  prosody
- [ ] Create a community effort to gather freely licensed speech in
  multiple languages
- [ ] [Train final multi-language
  models](https://github.com/collabora/spear-tts-pytorch/issues/12)

## Architecture

The general architecture is similar to
[AudioLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/),
[SPEAR TTS](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/speartts/examples/)
from Google and [MusicGen](https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/) from
Meta. We avoided the NIH syndrome and built it on top of powerful Open
Source models: [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) from OpenAI
to generate semantic tokens and perform transcription,
[EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) from Meta for
acoustic modeling and
[Vocos](https://github.com/charactr-platform/vocos) from Charactr Inc as
the high-quality vocoder.

We gave two presentation diving deeper into WhisperSpeech. The first one
talks about the challenges of large scale training:

### Whisper for modeling semantic tokens

We utilize the OpenAI Whisper encoder block to generate embeddings which
we then quantize to get semantic tokens.

If the language is already supported by Whisper then this process
requires only audio files (without ground truth transcriptions).

## EnCodec for modeling acoustic tokens

We use EnCodec to model the audio waveform. Out of the box it delivers
reasonable quality at 1.5kbps and we can bring this to high-quality by
using Vocos – a vocoder pretrained on EnCodec tokens.
