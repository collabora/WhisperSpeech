An Open Source text-to-speech system built by inverting Whisper.
Previously known as **spear-tts-pytorch**.

We want this model to be like Stable Diffusion but for speech – both
powerful and easily customizable.

We are working only with properly licensed speech recordings and all the
code is Open Source so the model will be always safe to use for
commercial applications.

Currently the models are trained on the English LibreLight dataset. In
the next release we want to target multiple languages (Whisper and
EnCodec are both multilanguage).

## Progress update \[2023-12-10\]

Another trio of models, this time they support multiple languages
(English and Polish). Here are two new samples for a sneak peek. You can
[check out our
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/collabora/WhisperSpeech/blob/5ab823856c5387c49b38dcb692e2cbbfaa5972f2/Inference%20example.ipynb)
to try it yourself!

## Downloads

We encourage you to start with the Google Colab link above or run the
provided notebook locally. If you want to download manually or train the
models from scratch then both [the WhisperSpeech pre-trained
models](https://huggingface.co/collabora/whisperspeech) as well as [the
converted
datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/collabora/whisperspeech) are
available on HuggingFace.

## Architecture

The general architecture is similar to
[AudioLM](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/audiolm/examples/),
[SPEAR TTS](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/speartts/examples/)
from Google and [MusicGen](https://ai.honu.io/papers/musicgen/) from
Meta. We avoided the NIH syndrome and built it on top of powerful Open
Source models: [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) from OpenAI
to generate semantic tokens and perform transcription,
[EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec) from Meta for
acoustic modeling and
[Vocos](https://github.com/charactr-platform/vocos) from Charactr Inc as
the high-quality vocoder.

### Whisper for modeling semantic tokens

We utilize the OpenAI Whisper encoder block to generate embeddings which
we then quantize with a small 2-layer model to get semantic tokens.

If the language is already supported by Whisper then this process
requires only audio files (without ground truth transcriptions).

## EnCodec for modeling acoustic tokens

We use EnCodec to model the audio waveform. Out of the box it delivers
reasonable quality at 1.5kbps and we can bring this to high-quality by
using Vocos – a vocoder pretrained on EnCodec tokens.
